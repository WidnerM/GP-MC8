This extension allows the user to assign an unlimited number of widgets to the buttons of the MC8.  It operates with only one
Bank on the MC8 and allows the user to page through different widgets as well as Rackspaces/Songs or Variations/Songparts.

Widgets from both the Global rackspace and the "local" Rackspaces are scanned and assigned placed on the MC8 as Rackspaces are changed.

The MC8 can be viewed physically as two rows of switches (top and bottom) and their corresponding display segments.
MC8 Banks have two pages, so it can effectively be viewed as four rows of four switches.

At any given time each row can control widgets, Rackspaces, Songs, Variations, or Songparts.  A row can only show four items at a time,
but what is shown can by cycled through any number of widgets, Songs, etc. through up and down buttons.

In my normal use I have variations across the top row, FX toggles on the bottom row on page one.  On page two I have Rackspace
selects on the bottom row, and Play/Stop, Setlist mode on/off, Tap Tempo, and Tuner on the top row.



All behavior of the MC8 extention is determined by named widgets within a GigPerformaer Rackspace
	Upon a Rackspace being activated the extension will scan all widgets in the rackspace (local and global)
	The "Advanced" tab of each GP widget has a field called "OSC/GPScript Name" that will be used to determine whether the extension will monitor the widget
		If the OSC/GPScript Name begins with "mcx_" the extension will monitor it
	
Widgets that will be utilized up by this extention must be named in the format:
	mcx_[displayrow]_[bank ID]_[position]
	mcx_[displayrow]p_[bank ID]_[position]
	mcx_[displayrow]_[bank ID]_i

Valid [displayrow] fields are:
	t for the top row on Page 1
	b for the bottom row on Page 1
	t2 for the top row on Page 2
	b2 for the bottom row on Page 2

Each row can be switched between any number of "banks" of buttons.  The "bank ID" field is used to identify different banks on each row.
	If you have 8 different effects toggles you want to appear on the bottom row you could organize them into two groups of four and page between them.
	A typical example would be to create a bank_ID group called "fx1" and another called "fx2".
	The widgets would be named mcx_b_fx1_0, mcx_b_fx1_1, etc. and mcx_b_fx2_0, mcx_b_fx2, etc.

Each of those widgets can have an associated 'p' (for "parameter") widget.  e.g., mcx_bp_fx1_0, mcx_bp_fx1_1, etc.
	These are typically text widgets with the "hide" option set, so that they are not visible outside of "Edit" mode.
	These control what appears on the MC8 display for that widget when it is on and off.  The on and off lables are separated by the underscore character.
	Examples would be "Chorus_(Chorus)" or "Reverb_(Reverb)". If no 'p' widget is defined the regular widget label will be used.



Each bank of controls has an associated "_i" widget that can be used to provide feedback on the GP rackspace screen
	Text widgets in GP are generally the most useful for these
		When a bank is active the extention will set its value (effectively brightness) to 1 to raise its visibility in GP
			Non-active bank indicators will have their value (brightness) set to 0.3 to reduce their visibility
